# Overview
In 2020 a coronavirus infection spread all over the world which forced all of the humanity to change their daily lives. Millions of people began to wear medical masks in the streets and many researchers started solving the problem of detecting medical masks on people's faces. In my project I tried to solve this problem on a small dataset using the Faster R-CNN model.
